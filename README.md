# pythonProject3_Matchmaker
When you run the program, it opens a window showing a grid of buttons. Click on them in pairs to reveal the hidden
symbols. If two symbols are the same, youâ€™ve found a match and the symbols remain visible on the screen. Otherwise, the
two buttons are reset. Try to remember the location of each hidden symbol to quickly find all the pairs.
